- Navigation image logo now has animation on hover to make it clear that you can click and go back to home page
- Navigation bar for mobile version is added
- Context menu is now added to note card to show options for editing, deleting and turn (note) private
- Edit now works inside a modal instead of 'in the note-card itself'
