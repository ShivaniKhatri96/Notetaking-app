# Noteworthy: A Notetaking-app
> Noteworthy is a notetaking app

### Tools used
> Frontend
- `Vue 3` used as a Frontend Framework
- `Vue-router` used for routing
- `Pinia` used for managing global states 
- `Vanilla CSS` used  for styling
- `font awesome` used for icons
> I didn't use CSS framework because I am working with a new javascript Framework. So, I wanted to keep things as simple as possible to make learning Vue.js smoother.

> Backend
- `Node.js`
- `Express.js`
- `MongoDB (cloud)`
> I didn't spent too much too on `backend`. So, it might not be perfect. My focus was to make `frontend` better.

### Responsive Design
- The website is responsive. It works on all devices.
> I will improve the responsiveness in version2 and make it better. 
> Here, you can see example for small and large screens

### Functionalities
- Requires a login to access
- It allows for more than one user. Each user have a username and an individual password
- The app allows the user to create and read notes
- Created notes are saved and retrieved on next visit
- It shows which user created a note
- It allows only note's creator to edit and delete it
> Basically, POC and MVP are completed. 

### Things I want to add and improve in version2
- Allow a note's creator to make it private. 
> The idea is to show the private notes in `MyNotesView` page. I will do it in version2
- Be accessible from a public url
- Fix bug related to context menu I created. It tends to overflow from the window
- Navigation bar for mobile version: different style basically
> I will be working on these on `version2` branch during my free time

### Links used
- [Adobe express](https://new.express.adobe.com/) used for creating logo
- box-shadow used from [css-box-shadow-examples](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples)
- [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) used for icons
- [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) used to generate animated drawings

### Final Words
